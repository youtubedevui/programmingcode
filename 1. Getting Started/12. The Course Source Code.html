<p>If you're facing issues or you're getting error messages, <strong>compare your code to mine</strong>!Â History shows that pretty much all issues can be solved by doing that.</p><p>You find my code <strong>attached to multiple lectures</strong> per module and <strong>always to the last lecture </strong>of each module (this lecture here is an exception - we simply got no important code in this first section). </p><p>Once you downloaded + extracted the attachments, you can run <code>npm install</code> followed by <code>ionic serve</code> (later, once we added the Ionic CLI) to run the code examples.</p>
