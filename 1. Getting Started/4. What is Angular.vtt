00:02.280 --> 00:05.780
Now that we had a first look at what Ionic is

00:05.790 --> 00:10.130
and no worries if that was a lot, we'll learn about these different building blocks

00:10.140 --> 00:15.360
step-by-step throughout the course, we'll learn about the web components and then we'll learn about Capacitor

00:15.360 --> 00:16.950
and how that works together,

00:16.950 --> 00:18.060
no worries

00:18.060 --> 00:19.920
but now that we learned about that,

00:20.010 --> 00:22.570
what is Angular? And I want to be honest here,

00:22.590 --> 00:27.900
you should know that, knowing Angular is a prerequisite to this course.

00:27.900 --> 00:32.330
There is a complete refresher module after this first module,

00:32.340 --> 00:36.200
this is entirely optional and it should really just be a refresher,

00:36.210 --> 00:39.140
it will not teach you Angular from the ground up,

00:39.150 --> 00:45.270
it will only refresh your knowledge in case it's been some time since you last worked with Angular. Knowing

00:45.270 --> 00:46.640
Angular is a prerequisite

00:46.650 --> 00:52.650
and if you don't, check out my complete Angular guide to learn all about Angular which you will also

00:52.650 --> 01:02.310
need in this course. Angular is of course a framework which makes the development of web apps, Javascript

01:02.370 --> 01:08.790
driven web apps easier and more fun and allows us to write more powerful apps because we don't

01:08.790 --> 01:14.940
have to focus on the nitty-gritty details but we can use Angular to take care about all the rendering

01:14.940 --> 01:21.240
of the UI and of creating a nice single page application and we can focus on our business logic and

01:21.240 --> 01:23.790
therefore, tools or frameworks like Angular

01:23.820 --> 01:28.460
help us write highly reactive Javascript-driven web apps.

01:28.770 --> 01:34.500
It's absolutely optional, we could do everything with vanilla Javascript but then we really couldn't

01:34.530 --> 01:38.290
because we would have to reinvent the wheel all over the place,

01:38.310 --> 01:45.260
we would probably introduce bugs and Angular does the same we could do but in a best practice way it

01:45.270 --> 01:52.680
makes the way free for us to work and focus on our own business logic. And we also use Angular to build

01:52.700 --> 01:59.490
so-called single page applications which are apps that run on one and the same HTML page, where this

01:59.490 --> 02:03.240
page or parts of this page are constantly re-rendered

02:03.240 --> 02:09.660
via Javascript, in the end triggered and controlled through Angular but which to the user looks like

02:09.660 --> 02:15.510
sometimes the entire page changes and that simply creates the illusion of having different pages we

02:15.510 --> 02:21.300
can switch between whilst all the transitions and so on our instant because it's Javascript running in

02:21.300 --> 02:21.860
the browser,

02:21.870 --> 02:27.120
we don't need to wait for a server response and that's why we build apps with Javascript and why we

02:27.330 --> 02:30.940
power so much logic in our apps with Javascript.

02:31.020 --> 02:36.930
Now in an Ionic app, we essentially would want to use a framework like Angular because it helps us with

02:36.930 --> 02:43.200
complex problems like state or data management between different pages for example, which can become

02:43.200 --> 02:49.440
quite difficult in bigger apps and it helps us with things like routing or navigation, so switching between

02:49.440 --> 02:53.790
these different pages and passing data around between them and so on

02:53.970 --> 02:56.090
and I will come back to this later in the course.

02:56.220 --> 03:00.390
This is Angular, as I said if it's been some time since you last worked with it,

03:00.390 --> 03:01.970
have a look at this refresher

03:01.980 --> 03:08.280
I have after this module. If Angular isn't your thing, then this might not be 100% the right

03:08.280 --> 03:16.260
course for you but I want to highlight at this point that Ionic also works with just Javascript, no framework

03:16.350 --> 03:23.410
at all or with other frameworks or libraries, so you can use it with React or Vue as well if you want.

03:23.490 --> 03:28.230
You should still, in case you want to go that route and you don't want to refund the course which is

03:28.230 --> 03:33.810
nice of course, you should go through the Quick Start parts, the first sections of this course to

03:33.810 --> 03:39.510
learn how Ionic works and you will then still be able to use that knowledge with these other frameworks,

03:39.960 --> 03:45.720
even though some things will differ there but you will know which things differ by the end of these

03:45.720 --> 03:51.250
first sections because the Ionic components you use and the way you use them will be the same.

03:51.570 --> 03:56.700
And speaking of that, it's time to get our hands dirty and start using some Ionic components.
