WEBVTT

00:02.140 --> 00:05.910
We're almost done getting started. In the next module,

00:05.920 --> 00:10.870
I'll give you an Angular refresher since we'll use Angular in this course.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.970
Now knowing Angular is in prerequisite to this course but maybe it's been some time since we last worked

00:15.970 --> 00:16.600
with it,

00:16.630 --> 00:19.170
maybe you're only barely touched on it,

00:19.240 --> 00:24.340
then this module will help you get back into Angular and its core concepts.

00:24.340 --> 00:30.100
Please note that this is of course a totally optional module because it is a prerequisite, if you

00:30.100 --> 00:31.330
already know Angular,

00:31.390 --> 00:36.680
you can simply fast forward through this module or entirely skip it. Now

00:36.710 --> 00:44.170
once we are done with that refresher, we'll finally dive into Ionic and there into its basics and most

00:44.170 --> 00:51.110
importantly in its component basics because Ionic mostly is a component framework or library and therefore

00:51.160 --> 00:53.290
components are its core

00:53.290 --> 01:00.370
and in this module, we'll dive into how to use them, how to configure them and all of that even without Angular.

01:00.430 --> 01:06.040
No worries we'll add Angular back into the app later but here you'll learn all the basics about Ionic

01:06.220 --> 01:10.320
without even needing Angular which shows a great strength of Ionic,

01:10.360 --> 01:15.770
it works with or without a framework and in this course, you'll essentially learn both.

01:15.790 --> 01:21.280
Now once we're done with the component basics, we'll connect Ionic to Angular and you will learn why you

01:21.280 --> 01:27.880
might want to do that and where the strengths of this combination lie and how to use both together, how

01:27.880 --> 01:35.020
to inject certain Ionic controllers and elements into Angular components and how Angular components

01:35.050 --> 01:37.210
and Ionic components work together,

01:37.240 --> 01:42.430
really exciting stuff. Once we're done with that, it's time to leave

01:42.430 --> 01:49.240
the component world a little bit and focus on another core strength of Ionic, what it historically

01:49.270 --> 01:55.900
always did. It always allowed you to build native mobile apps with web technologies,

01:55.900 --> 02:01.570
so with a framework like Angular and therefore in this next module, we'll build native apps with a tool

02:01.570 --> 02:08.890
called capacitor which is also managed and developed by the Ionic team, which we can use to take our

02:08.950 --> 02:14.860
Ionic and Angular web app and convert it into a real native mobile app and you'll learn how that works

02:14.860 --> 02:17.680
and how to run your app on mobile devices

02:17.680 --> 02:24.520
in this section therefore. Thereafter I'll teach you how to debug your Ionic apps because things not

02:24.550 --> 02:26.520
always go as planned and therefore

02:26.530 --> 02:33.760
this is a crucial skill to have, before we then dive into navigation and routing in Ionic Angular apps

02:34.090 --> 02:40.300
because switching between different pages is a task you do all the time in web apps and mobile apps,

02:40.600 --> 02:46.420
you constantly navigate back and forth, in this module, you will learn how to Angular router and Ionic

02:46.420 --> 02:53.800
work together when it comes to switching between pages. Thereafter, we'll dive deeper into Ionic components

02:53.800 --> 03:00.010
and I'll give you a very thorough overview of all the Ionic components and how to think about them and

03:00.010 --> 03:01.330
how to configure them,

03:01.330 --> 03:07.330
so this will then really allow you to build any kind of app we want with Ionic's help before we then

03:07.330 --> 03:12.430
dive into styling and theming because obviously you don't just want to use components, you want to make

03:12.430 --> 03:19.000
your app look good and here you'll learn how to do that with the help of Ionic and how to properly assign

03:19.000 --> 03:25.060
your own style, your own corporate identity to an Ionic and Angular app or basically to Ionic

03:25.060 --> 03:25.350
app

03:25.360 --> 03:29.560
you could say. Well, what would an app be without fetching user input

03:29.560 --> 03:30.130
right

03:30.190 --> 03:32.630
and that is indeed what we'll dive into thereafter.

03:32.680 --> 03:39.610
You will learn how to work with forms, with Angular forms in Ionic apps and how to use Ionic components,

03:39.940 --> 03:42.130
input components in these forms,

03:42.130 --> 03:44.110
so how that works together.

03:44.230 --> 03:50.230
Now whenever you gathered some data or you have some data in your application, state management becomes

03:50.230 --> 03:57.230
an issue and therefore I have a whole module dedicated on how you manage state in an Ionic Angular application

03:57.340 --> 04:03.400
before we then also dive into sending HTTP requests, so that you're not limited to just mentioning data

04:03.400 --> 04:10.720
locally on your device or in your app but that you can also store it on servers somewhere in the Internet.

04:10.780 --> 04:17.290
Now when you think about typical native apps and that is still one of the core focuses of Ionic, building

04:17.290 --> 04:18.280
native apps,

04:18.280 --> 04:25.000
so if you think of such native apps, what often comes to mind is using maps or the camera in there.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
Well I will cover both in this course and I will start by adding Google Maps in a specific section where

04:31.000 --> 04:37.240
I will show you how to add that, how to unlock the API and how to use Google Maps from scratch in an

04:37.240 --> 04:41.640
Ionic app before we then dive into native device features in general,

04:41.710 --> 04:45.950
like using the camera or fetching the current user location.

04:46.150 --> 04:53.590
Now that is all nice but what would a real app be without some user authentication? And therefore, I got

04:53.590 --> 04:59.820
a whole module dedicated to showing you how to add authentication to your application.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.880
And once we did all that, we'll have quite a nice app

05:04.000 --> 05:05.950
and that is another important thing

05:06.010 --> 05:12.880
throughout this course, we built a project, a realistic project and I will demo most of these things on

05:12.880 --> 05:14.170
that project.

05:14.170 --> 05:20.440
There are some side projects or small demos as well but I believe you'll learn the most if you

05:20.440 --> 05:24.550
work on a concrete example, on a concrete project and therefore

05:24.550 --> 05:30.040
this is what we'll do in this course as well. And once we finish that project which we'll have after

05:30.040 --> 05:35.410
the authentication section, it is of course time to publish the app and therefore in the publishing

05:35.410 --> 05:41.110
section, I will teach you how you can get your application into the Google Play Store, into the Apple

05:41.110 --> 05:47.590
App Store or also publish it as a web app because that's something you can build with Ionic and Angular

05:47.590 --> 05:48.070
too,

05:48.190 --> 05:53.530
you can ship a regular web app or even a progressive web app which I will show to you as well.

05:54.490 --> 05:55.600
And that's it,

05:55.600 --> 06:00.100
we're then done and I will conclude the course give you some next steps

06:00.100 --> 06:06.880
but by that point, by that time, you will have learned all you need to build amazing Ionic apps and build

06:06.880 --> 06:12.670
up on the foundation you get in this course with the official docs, with other resources and of course by

06:12.670 --> 06:19.000
simply building a ton of stuff and that will enable you to build any kind of app you want with Ionic

06:19.180 --> 06:20.280
and Angular.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.420
So let's dive in.
