00:02.320 --> 00:09.910
So what is Ionic? In the past, this would have been a bit easier to answer because Ionic evolved quite

00:09.910 --> 00:12.740
a bit across the last years

00:12.820 --> 00:18.150
and I'll come back to a brief history and future outlook later in this module.

00:18.250 --> 00:24.500
So assuming that you don't know anything about Ionic, which is fine, this course is for you just as it

00:24.500 --> 00:29.740
is for people who know a little bit about Ionic or have worked with older versions of Ionic,

00:30.430 --> 00:38.120
Ionic in the end is all about having one codebase which is the codebase for a web app and therefore

00:38.170 --> 00:40.800
uses HTML, Javascript and CSS,

00:40.810 --> 00:48.130
so what you would use to build normal user interfaces in the web and you use these tools and these techniques

00:48.130 --> 00:55.090
and these languages which you already know and take some magic to which I will come back in the next

00:55.090 --> 01:01.840
few seconds, added by Ionic to generate web apps, progressive web apps and I'll come back to what this is

01:01.840 --> 01:02.890
in a second too,

01:03.010 --> 01:09.220
iOS and Android apps and if you want, even electron desktop apps. Electron is a certain technology

01:09.220 --> 01:12.970
that allows you to wrap a web app into a desktop app

01:13.000 --> 01:20.470
so to say. So you can build an app for different platforms with one and the same codebase, with minor

01:20.470 --> 01:25.290
adjustments as you will learn in this course but really minor adjustments, not big ones

01:25.420 --> 01:28.280
and that of course is a big selling point.

01:28.390 --> 01:34.360
You can use your existing knowledge and get different apps which allows you to distribute your app on

01:34.360 --> 01:35.950
different channels.

01:35.950 --> 01:41.740
Now regarding that progressive web app part, a progressive web app in the end is a normal web app that

01:41.800 --> 01:44.470
looks and feels a bit like a native mobile app.

01:44.470 --> 01:46.130
It isn't a native mobile app,

01:46.210 --> 01:46.750
you don't

01:46.750 --> 01:48.800
distribute it through the app stores,

01:48.820 --> 01:54.520
it's still a website which you can find why via Google and so on but it's optimized to be reliable

01:54.520 --> 01:59.150
which means it even works offline or parts of it work offline,

01:59.290 --> 02:05.860
it should be fast and give the an user instant feedback upon actions and you also want to have an engaging

02:05.860 --> 02:12.640
app which is able to tap into some native device features, like using the location of the user or the

02:12.640 --> 02:17.440
camera. And with Ionic, you can build such a progressive web app,

02:17.440 --> 02:24.130
you can also build a normal web app which isn't particularly fast or which doesn't tap into native device

02:24.130 --> 02:32.350
features and you can also though get a real native app out of it, so that you can really target the broadest

02:32.530 --> 02:35.320
range of channels possible.

02:35.330 --> 02:40.970
Now let's dive a bit deeper into the Ionic platform then because it's nice that we know that with Ionic

02:41.000 --> 02:43.700
we can build such cross platform apps

02:43.780 --> 02:44.830
but what does this mean,

02:44.830 --> 02:46.090
what really is Ionic,

02:46.090 --> 02:47.080
how does it do that,

02:47.080 --> 02:49.210
what's this magic ingredient

02:49.210 --> 03:00.010
it adds? The Ionic platform as we should call it, is all about Ionic which in its core is a set of web components.

03:00.070 --> 03:06.640
Now web components on the other hand are a technique, a technology supported by modern browsers which allows

03:06.640 --> 03:08.740
you to basically build your own HTML

03:08.770 --> 03:15.430
elements that behind the scenes have more complex logic, something like a tabs component let's say

03:15.430 --> 03:17.800
where the user can toggle between different tabs.

03:17.920 --> 03:22.660
In the past, you could build something like this on your own by writing your own HTML, adding your own

03:22.660 --> 03:28.180
CSS and adding your own Javascript logic, Ionic gives you such a functionality packaged up in

03:28.180 --> 03:34.660
a finished, ready-to-use web component and it has lots of web components you can use. And that is the core

03:34.660 --> 03:43.660
of Ionic, this suite of nicely styled, platform-agnostic and automatically adjusting, so that the automatic

03:43.670 --> 03:50.590
you'll have to look of the platform you're running on web components which can dump into your web project.

03:50.590 --> 03:56.500
So these custom HTML elements could be built by you but with Ionic, you don't have to, you get a finished

03:56.590 --> 03:59.140
suite of such web components.

03:59.200 --> 04:05.360
Now these web components therefore are what you can see on the screen but Ionic and the Ionic ecosystem

04:05.380 --> 04:11.710
is more than just that because Ionic is not just this suite of components, Ionic is also the name of the

04:11.710 --> 04:16.210
company who developed or which developed these components

04:16.210 --> 04:22.600
and this company has more than just these components suite, it also works on a tool named capacitor.

04:22.600 --> 04:30.160
Now capacitor is essentially a tool that is capable of taking your existing web app and wrapping it

04:30.250 --> 04:34.000
into a so-called web view into a native mobile app.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.370
So in the end, it gives you a native mobile app that runs your web app inside of it

04:39.370 --> 04:46.690
but in a way that is indistinguishable for the user to a normal native app because it is a normal native

04:46.690 --> 04:49.720
app, just with a web app included in it

04:49.720 --> 04:56.170
but it looks and feels like a regular mobile app which you build with native mobile controls as you

04:56.170 --> 04:57.760
will see in this course

04:57.760 --> 05:03.830
and that's amazing because this allows you to take your web app and convert it into a mobile app easily.

05:03.850 --> 05:09.040
Now if you're a little bit more experienced in this area. you also might know Cordova which is a similar

05:09.040 --> 05:15.910
tool doing something similar, capacitor is basically a more modern version of that built from the ground

05:15.910 --> 05:21.880
up by the people at Ionic who have a lot of experience with that, who used Cordova in the past but now

05:21.880 --> 05:27.520
have their own solution which we'll also use in this course which is super fast, super easy-to-use and

05:27.520 --> 05:30.540
makes it really easy to build native mobile apps.

05:30.580 --> 05:36.970
So this is the part that allows us to use our web app and run it on a native device as a native mobile

05:36.970 --> 05:40.160
app and not just as a website opened in the browser.

05:40.240 --> 05:47.800
Now last but not least, the Ionic platform, so the set of tools we use from the Ionic ecosystem also has

05:47.800 --> 05:54.250
the Ionic CLI which stands for command line interface, which can work with other CLIs, like in this course

05:54.250 --> 06:01.370
the Angular CLI which it will use behind the scenes, which helps us create Ionic projects, manage them,

06:01.930 --> 06:05.690
use capacitor to convert our web app into a mobile app,

06:05.800 --> 06:12.610
so basically which helps us with the entire build workflow, that is the last important part from the Ionic

06:12.610 --> 06:21.020
world we'll be using. This makes developing simply easier, faster and allows us to finally build and package

06:21.020 --> 06:28.650
our app up. Now this is the Ionic platform, these are the tools you will learn about in this course in detail and

06:28.650 --> 06:30.750
this is just a big picture here obviously

06:31.040 --> 06:37.530
and this is what Ionic gives us to build amazing web apps which can work and run as web apps but then

06:37.530 --> 06:41.730
they look like native mobile apps already, thanks to these nice

06:41.740 --> 06:47.370
Ionic web components which by the way are also not just about the looks but also have a

06:47.370 --> 06:53.910
lot of rich functionality included in them, like this tab functionality I mentioned earlier but then

06:53.910 --> 06:59.430
Ionic doesn't stop there, doesn't stop at that web user interface, it then also gives you the tool to

06:59.430 --> 07:06.390
build that in an easy way and to then also convert it into mobile apps or even desktop apps if you want

07:06.390 --> 07:13.350
to. This is the Ionic platform in its core, there also are certain premium and cloud services offered

07:13.350 --> 07:17.400
by Ionic, for some of them you have to pay, others are free,

07:17.430 --> 07:23.100
I won't dive too much into them in this course but I want to mention nonetheless, these services allow

07:23.100 --> 07:24.850
you to build your app in the cloud,

07:24.870 --> 07:27.780
for example if you want to build an iOS app on Windows,

07:27.780 --> 07:33.900
this would be possible with the services and they also have other services for easier development

07:33.930 --> 07:39.330
or previewing and you can find all of that on their official web page which I'll also show you in a

07:39.330 --> 07:39.930
second.

07:40.050 --> 07:41.790
But this is Ionic in its core.
