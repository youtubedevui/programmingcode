00:02.670 --> 00:08.370
Now that we have this detailed first look at what Ionic is and which kind of tools it gives us,

00:08.370 --> 00:12.180
let's take a closer look at this Ionic ecosystem

00:12.330 --> 00:19.530
and for that, let's go back to our starting point which is that we want to build a web app with or without

00:19.530 --> 00:20.430
any framework,

00:20.460 --> 00:26.820
so in this course with Angular but you could even build it with vanilla Javascript or with React or Vue,

00:27.380 --> 00:30.340
Ionic works with all these alternatives.

00:30.390 --> 00:36.300
So you're building this web app and you want to keep it as a web app, possibly a so-called progressive

00:36.360 --> 00:38.850
web app with these cooler features,

00:38.850 --> 00:41.720
this fast and reliable interaction

00:41.850 --> 00:47.190
and you also want to have a native mobile app and then you have these suite of web components which

00:47.370 --> 00:51.730
look like this, which look like normal HTML tags except for that they aren't.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.690
You then have your tools to convert

00:53.700 --> 01:00.210
this app and you have your tools for the development, so the Ionic CLI and so on. This is essentially what

01:00.210 --> 01:02.070
we saw in the last lecture already

01:02.070 --> 01:07.500
but this is just another way of depicting it or of showing it on a slide.

01:07.500 --> 01:13.020
Now of course with that knowledge in mind, we can create an Ionic project and we'll do so in this section

01:13.020 --> 01:14.250
already.

01:14.250 --> 01:22.920
Now this project essentially is all about our app, so about our code we write to create a nice web application,

01:22.920 --> 01:23.840
a nice website

01:23.850 --> 01:24.870
in the end

01:24.870 --> 01:27.520
and that of course means we will write our own code

01:27.570 --> 01:34.580
and again, that could be written in vanilla Javascript or with any framework like in this course with Angular.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.350
So we add such a front-end framework and that is optional

01:38.400 --> 01:43.520
as I just mentioned, you could use vanilla Javascript and then we add the Ionic framework,

01:43.530 --> 01:52.140
so this set of Ionic web components to get nice, rich, web elements added to this app automatically or with

01:52.140 --> 01:58.440
very little effort, so that the app already looks nice and has a lot of nice capabilities which would

01:58.440 --> 02:02.190
be quite a lot of work to build on our own otherwise.

02:02.250 --> 02:08.910
So with that added and with a lot of cool functionalities added therefore, we can continue. Now as a side

02:08.910 --> 02:13.950
note because that's already interesting to know here, the web components we're adding here, the Ionic

02:13.950 --> 02:17.550
web components are built with a tool called Stencil.

02:17.550 --> 02:20.870
You don't need to learn Stencil to work with Ionic, not at all

02:20.880 --> 02:23.160
and we will not learn it in this course

02:23.160 --> 02:27.640
but if you want to learn how the Ionic web components were built behind the scenes,

02:27.690 --> 02:32.280
so if you want to know a little bit more about that or if you want to build your own web components

02:32.430 --> 02:38.490
which you can use in conjunction with your framework and with Ionic, then learning Stencil could be

02:38.490 --> 02:39.330
well worth it

02:39.600 --> 02:43.950
and I do have a complete web component with and without Stencil of course,

02:43.950 --> 02:46.100
so all in one course here on Udemy.

02:46.140 --> 02:51.690
So definitely check this out if you want to learn all about the technology the Ionic team used to build

02:51.690 --> 02:58.610
their Ionic web components but that's just a side note. So these web components are built with Stencil

02:58.640 --> 03:03.950
and that is all done for you, you just add these web components. And in the end, you can then build different

03:03.950 --> 03:08.440
kinds of apps based on your single codebase based on your app

03:08.540 --> 03:11.760
and this is again done with Capacitor or Cordova

03:11.780 --> 03:16.650
as I mentioned, in this course we'll use Capacitor which is a tool developed by the Ionic team,

03:16.700 --> 03:23.120
so we'll stay entirely in that Ionic world and what this tool in the end does is it acts as a bridge

03:23.150 --> 03:28.880
between our web code, our web Javascript code and then the native platform we're running on.

03:28.880 --> 03:35.030
So that from our Javascript code, we can trigger certain functions which then in the end trigger native

03:35.030 --> 03:36.410
code on your device,

03:36.440 --> 03:43.940
so real native code there to for example open the camera, to get the user location, to show an alert or

03:43.940 --> 03:45.280
anything like that,

03:45.320 --> 03:52.040
this can then be done with real native code executed on your behalf without you needing to write it

03:52.510 --> 03:59.120
by tools like Capacitor or Cordova which you can even use kind of together as I'll also show in

03:59.120 --> 03:59.810
this course

03:59.810 --> 04:03.140
but we'll primarily use Capacitor here.

04:03.140 --> 04:09.240
So this is what Ionic is all about, in this course we will learn all about Ionic,

04:09.350 --> 04:17.510
we will do that with Angular as a front-end framework and we'll also learn about Capacitor and we will

04:17.510 --> 04:25.200
then therefore build a progressive web app, as well as our mobile apps. We'll not cover Stencil or anything

04:25.210 --> 04:25.850
like that.
