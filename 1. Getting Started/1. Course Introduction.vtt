Welcome to this course,

00:04.250 --> 00:07.400
I'm super excited to have you on board. In this course,

00:07.400 --> 00:14.210
we're going to dive into Ionic with Angular. As you will learn, Ionic is an amazing framework that helps

00:14.210 --> 00:20.890
you build mobile apps with web technologies and indeed in this course, we'll learn it from scratch,

00:20.900 --> 00:26.660
you will learn all about Ionic, its many components it offers, its building blocks it offers and we will

00:26.660 --> 00:31.520
build a real mobile apps that we deploy to the Apple App Store and the Google Play store at the end

00:31.520 --> 00:32.600
of this course.

00:32.690 --> 00:38.480
But even better than that, Ionic allows you to build cross-platform applications, which means you have

00:38.480 --> 00:44.030
one codebase and you get mobile apps out of it as well as a regular web app

00:44.090 --> 00:46.820
and that's also what we'll cover in this course.

00:46.820 --> 00:53.780
Now as already mentioned, this course is about Ionic and Angular, Angular being an amazing front-end framework

00:53.960 --> 00:56.580
that makes building such apps even easier.

00:56.590 --> 01:00.860
Therefore in this course, you get both and you just need the Angular basics, you don't need to know

01:00.860 --> 01:06.290
anything about Ionic and there even is an Angular refresher in this course in case it's been some time

01:06.290 --> 01:12.410
since you last worked with Angular. I also strongly believe that you learn way more when you're building

01:12.410 --> 01:18.110
something practical and that means that in this course, we'll build an entire course project. We'll plan it

01:18.230 --> 01:25.190
and then build it step-by-step, adding features like navigation, user interaction, fetching user inputs, showing

01:25.190 --> 01:31.970
modals and alerts, adding authentication, sending HTTP requests to the back-end, using the device camera, 

01:32.150 --> 01:37.420
adding Google Maps and so much more. Now this is what's in the course,

01:37.430 --> 01:38.630
who am I?

01:38.630 --> 01:43.970
My name is Maximilian Schwarzmuller and I'm a freelance web developer and five star rated instructor

01:43.970 --> 01:45.270
here on Udemy.

01:45.380 --> 01:52.010
I got many courses on web development including the biggest and best-selling course on Angular.

01:52.010 --> 01:59.000
I also created an Ionic course in the past, this course actually but I did re-record it entirely when

01:59.000 --> 02:04.940
Ionic 4 was released because that marked a breaking and important change in the Ionic history as you

02:04.940 --> 02:06.430
will also learn its course.

02:06.440 --> 02:11.840
So this course is fully up-to-date and it uses the latest technologies and the latest best practices

02:12.050 --> 02:19.250
to allow you to build cross-platform applications with web technologies, with Ionic and with Angular.

02:19.250 --> 02:24.670
And with that, let's dive right in and let's learn what exactly Ionic is and how it works.
