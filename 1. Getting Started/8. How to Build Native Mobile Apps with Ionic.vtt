00:02.160 --> 00:04.360
Now we're nearing the end of this module,

00:04.370 --> 00:11.330
there is just one important thing that is important to know about mobile apps built with Ionic.

00:11.370 --> 00:17.550
If you're building such a mobile app as I mentioned, in the end what we get is our code, our Ionic app

00:17.790 --> 00:24.050
with tools like Capacitor or Cordova is made available as a mobile app for these native platforms,

00:24.060 --> 00:30.560
so for Android and iOS and now we have two common ways of making that happen.

00:30.600 --> 00:37.920
We could compile our code to native code, so we could compile the code to Java for Android or to Objective

00:37.920 --> 00:46.950
C or Swift for iOS and compiling here especially talks about the templates, so a button, an ion-button

00:46.980 --> 00:54.180
we have in our template could be converted into a real native button or the alternative, we could wrap

00:54.240 --> 00:58.370
our web app into a web view. On native mobile apps,

00:58.470 --> 01:04.720
you can launch a web view in the application to host a web page inside of that app.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.380
You might know that from some apps like Twitter,

01:07.380 --> 01:14.850
if a person links some web page there and you tap it, you don't open your actual browser app and open

01:14.850 --> 01:15.800
the page there

01:15.870 --> 01:20.100
but inside of Twitter, a built-in browser opens up

01:20.150 --> 01:22.830
and this is not a browser developed by the Twitter guys,

01:22.860 --> 01:24.390
it's a so-called web view,

01:24.390 --> 01:28.640
it's in the end a special widget you can use a native app development,

01:28.770 --> 01:34.350
that is a fully fledged browser that doesn't look like one because you don't have a URL bar at

01:34.350 --> 01:35.370
the top and so on,

01:35.370 --> 01:43.180
it just is a fullscreen browser and that is what Ionic uses. With tools like Capacitor or Cordova, you

01:43.200 --> 01:50.340
in the end get a mobile app shell that has such a web view in it and also then has some capabilities of launching

01:50.340 --> 01:57.990
a simple web server, running mobile on the device that hosts your Ionic web app inside of that web

01:57.990 --> 02:00.590
view and then Cordova and Capacitor,

02:00.630 --> 02:01.900
that's the cool thing,

02:01.960 --> 02:04.200
also give you a bridge

02:04.230 --> 02:10.680
so to say through through you can tap into real native device features from inside your web app and

02:10.700 --> 02:14.200
that's the difference to a website running in a normal browser, there

02:14.220 --> 02:21.870
this is not possible, in a Capacitor app that is. So Ionic takes this approach of wrapping your app into

02:21.870 --> 02:22.340
a web

02:22.340 --> 02:26.510
view no matter if you using Capacitor or Cordova.

02:26.580 --> 02:32.310
Now that web view as I mentioned allows you to run your app, a normal web app inside of a native app that

02:32.310 --> 02:34.930
renders this full screen browser.

02:35.010 --> 02:42.570
Now you could say that this has to be slower than a compiled app where you work with the real native widgets

02:43.110 --> 02:45.240
and technically that would be true,

02:45.390 --> 02:51.270
such an app will be a little bit smaller because there is this extra wrapper and it is just a web page

02:51.900 --> 02:59.190
but it is super important to stress here that modern devices are so fast and an Ionic app typically

02:59.190 --> 03:06.570
uses so little performance that you will absolutely not see any difference and then you would just have

03:06.570 --> 03:13.170
the advantage of being able to build a cross-platform app with almost no effort at all, that looks and

03:13.170 --> 03:20.250
feels like a native app, that also is technically a native app and where you can tap into all the native

03:20.250 --> 03:27.060
device features like the camera you might need, just that if you look under the hood, it's not really

03:27.060 --> 03:31.950
compiled down to a native mobile app but instead it's wrapped into a native mobile app

03:31.950 --> 03:38.200
but again, the performance difference will in 99% of all cases not matter

03:38.220 --> 03:43.080
and I do mean it like this, not matter for you and you just reap the benefits.
