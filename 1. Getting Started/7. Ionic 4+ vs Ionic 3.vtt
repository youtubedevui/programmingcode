00:02.330 --> 00:05.380
In the last video, I had a look at the history of Ionic.

00:05.390 --> 00:08.370
If you have used Ionic 2 or 3,

00:08.390 --> 00:11.430
this video is for you, if you haven't, you can simply skip it.

00:11.450 --> 00:16.880
I want to dive into the important differences between Ionic 3 and Ionic 4 and what changed.

00:17.190 --> 00:17.380
Now

00:17.390 --> 00:23.270
first of all if you need to update an existing project to Ionic 4, there is a migration guide on the

00:23.270 --> 00:29.330
official page, on the official web page of Ionic. On ionicframework.com,

00:29.480 --> 00:36.680
you can go to guide here in the docs and you will find a migration guide here and that gives you a detailed

00:36.740 --> 00:43.670
overview of what changed from Ionic 3 to Ionic 4 and how you need to adjust your project to

00:43.730 --> 00:45.040
update it.

00:45.050 --> 00:51.380
So that is the detailed guide, I want to give you the rough overview of what changed. So an Ionic 3

00:51.380 --> 00:55.980
project use the Ionic CLI to generate such a project,

00:56.090 --> 01:02.240
we then used Cordova to also get a mobile app out of that and Ionic 2 and 3

01:02.240 --> 01:06.220
actually were mostly focused on getting these mobile apps, with Ionic 3,

01:06.220 --> 01:12.710
you could also build progressive web apps that was possible but the focus really was on this mobile

01:12.770 --> 01:15.290
app with web technologies

01:15.290 --> 01:18.040
thing. With Ionic 4, that's changing,

01:18.050 --> 01:25.280
we still have the Ionic CLI but we can actually also include Ionic 4 through a CDN and or through NPM,

01:25.460 --> 01:27.980
so we don't even need a CLI or

01:28.070 --> 01:35.510
any complex build workflow to use Ionic 4 which makes sense because it doesn't rely on a framework. And

01:35.510 --> 01:41.750
actually in the first real section of this course after the Angular refresher, I will show you how to

01:41.750 --> 01:47.660
include Ionic without any CLI, before we then use it again because we're also building an Angular

01:47.660 --> 01:48.690
app which needs one.

01:48.740 --> 01:49.740
So that's a first

01:49.760 --> 01:51.770
subtle but important difference,

01:51.800 --> 01:53.630
we can just use the Ionic CLI.

01:54.470 --> 02:01.010
We then in the end have a normal web project and an Ionic project in Ionic 3 and 2 also was

02:01.010 --> 02:07.620
a web project but it was highly geared towards getting out such a mobile app, such an Ionic-driven app.

02:07.640 --> 02:13.730
Now here, we have a normal web app project that also can spit out a real mobile app but doesn't have

02:13.730 --> 02:20.570
to because under the hood like the Ionic CLI for Angular, we use just the Angular CLI and similar

02:20.570 --> 02:26.480
things are offered for React and Vue, so we don't really have anything too different to a normal web

02:26.480 --> 02:28.700
app built with Angular or React,

02:28.730 --> 02:29.980
it's just a web app

02:30.050 --> 02:36.620
plus so to say with some extra features. And therefore what we get out could be a normal web app but

02:36.620 --> 02:43.010
we can also use Cordova or Capacitor, both supported now, Capacitor is this new tool offered by the Ionic

02:43.010 --> 02:47.700
team to get a mobile app and in this course, I will use Capacitor.

02:47.870 --> 02:49.970
So in the end, we got more flexibility,

02:49.970 --> 02:56.990
that's the general theme of Ionic 4, more flexibility and yet more stability and speed as well.

02:56.990 --> 03:01.970
This is the big picture, again for the detailed upgrade on what's technically changed,

03:01.970 --> 03:04.580
have a look at the official docs I showed you.
