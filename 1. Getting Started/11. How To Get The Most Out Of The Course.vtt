00:02.250 --> 00:05.360
We all want to dive into the course now and we will

00:05.430 --> 00:08.130
but how do you get the most out of the course

00:08.130 --> 00:10.040
because that is really important to me,

00:10.050 --> 00:13.560
I want that you get the most for your money possible.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.760
Now this is a video on-demand course,

00:15.780 --> 00:19.770
so obviously you should watch the videos. Go through them,

00:19.770 --> 00:25.560
have a look at them and pause them if you need to take some notes or if you are coding along, also

00:25.560 --> 00:31.590
take advantage of these Udemy playback controls in the video player. Speed me up if I'm going to slow,

00:31.980 --> 00:38.010
slow me down if I'm going too fast and jump back to videos you already watched to go through a concept

00:38.010 --> 00:43.590
again which wasn't very clear to you, that is a normal process of learning and it is the advantage of

00:43.590 --> 00:49.130
a video on-demand course, you can go through it at your speed so take advantage of that.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.800
Now as I mentioned, you should also code along,

00:51.840 --> 00:57.810
you learn the most by not just watching me talk but by really writing your own code and for that, pause

00:57.820 --> 01:02.120
the video, also try something on your own before watching my solution.

01:02.190 --> 01:07.670
Do the assignments you find in this course and take advantage of all the different tools you have here.

01:07.710 --> 01:13.740
Now you will definitely also run into errors and you will learn in this course how to debug errors

01:13.740 --> 01:19.740
and as always, I recommend that you should try to solve errors on your own because you'll learn the most

01:20.010 --> 01:22.020
if you fix your own errors.

01:22.020 --> 01:27.970
Google is your friend, put your error message into Google and often, you will find a solution there.

01:27.990 --> 01:31.020
Now also dive into the official docs,

01:31.020 --> 01:37.050
these dccs are awesome and you find all the built-in components there, a lot of useful guides and a

01:37.050 --> 01:43.890
lot of useful resources that teach you how to work with Ionic and might help you understand why something

01:43.890 --> 01:49.320
doesn't work the way you would think it works because it's not how the Ionic team intended it to

01:49.320 --> 01:51.230
be used for example.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.620
Last but not least, this course as all Udemy courses has a Q&A section where you can ask,

01:57.810 --> 02:02.100
now only ask if you have exhausted other resources,

02:02.100 --> 02:08.160
also if you compared your code to mine. Attached to multiple lectures in this course and always to the

02:08.160 --> 02:13.860
last lecture of every module, you find snapshots of the code for this module.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.170
Take that code and compare it to yours,

02:16.230 --> 02:19.990
that also allows you to find and fix a lot of issues.

02:20.280 --> 02:25.940
And only after you went through all these steps or when a certain concept is really unclear,

02:25.950 --> 02:28.890
ask in the Q&A section but don't just ask

02:28.900 --> 02:31.080
there, also answer,

02:31.080 --> 02:37.710
help your fellow students because just as with coding along, if you're forced to think about a problem

02:37.710 --> 02:44.100
and solve it on your own, you get way more out of this than if you just passively sit there and ask and

02:44.100 --> 02:45.260
wait for help.

02:45.270 --> 02:51.660
Sometimes this is necessary but often, you can make the difference by helping other students, not just personally

02:51.750 --> 02:55.260
but also for you because you will learn even more.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.880
And if you take all these things into account, you should be getting a lot out of this course.
